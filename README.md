# AbimoOS-1.78-Beta

AbimoOS is a custom-designed operating system UI concept built from scratch using Figma.
This version (Beta 1.78) represents a major leap in design language, combining the gloss of Windows 7 with the sleek minimalism of Windows 11 ‚Äî all crafted by a solo developer, on mobile devices.

Made by: Hinamo (Solo developer, system thinker, visual learner, and the first Indonesian PPTOS Maker (2020)).

Tools Used: Figma (UI/UX Design), Xiaomi Pad 7 + Vivo Y22 (main devices), AND 5 DAYS OF TRIAL AND ERROR üò≠üôèüèª

What's inside AbimoOS 1.78 Beta:
1. New glossy UI with depth and light
2. Custom app icons & launcher grid
3. Interactive lockscreen prototype
4. Notification center (early concept)
5. OOBE (Out-of-Box Experience) screen

100% pixel-aligned and handmade, no templates used


Background:

AbimoOS started as a dream ‚Äî to go beyond "fake OS projects" on PowerPoint (PPTOS), and build something real, beautiful, and scalable.
1.75 was great, but it died too early. So I rebuilt it. 1.78 is not just an update, it's a revival.
